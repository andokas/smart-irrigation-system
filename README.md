# Smart Irrigation System üå±

## Problem

Plants require consistent and appropriate watering to survive and thrive, yet manual watering methods are unreliable and inefficient. The main problems include:

- **Inconsistent watering schedules** due to human forgetfulness or busy lifestyles
- **Inability to water plants** during vacations, business trips, or extended absences
- **Overwatering or underwatering** caused by guesswork rather than actual soil conditions
- **No adaptation to environmental conditions** such as temperature changes affecting plant water needs
- **Water waste** from unnecessary watering when soil is already moist
- **Plant stress or death** from dehydration during hot weather
- **Lack of real-time feedback** on soil and environmental conditions
- **No emergency override** when manual intervention is necessary

These issues result in unhealthy plants, wasted water resources, and frustrated gardeners who want a more reliable solution.

## Design

The Smart Irrigation System is an Arduino-based automated solution that combines multiple sensors with intelligent control logic to provide optimal plant care.

### System Architecture

**Input Sensors:**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Continuously monitors soil humidity levels through analog readings (0-1023 scale)
- **TMP36 Temperature Sensor**: Measures ambient temperature to adapt watering schedules
- **Pushbutton**: Allows manual override for emergency or supplemental watering

**Control Logic:**
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: System adjusts moisture thresholds based on temperature
  - Normal conditions: Dry (<400), Medium (400-700), Wet (>700)
  - Hot conditions (>25¬∞C): Adjusted for more frequent watering - Dry (<500), Medium (500-750), Wet (>750)
- **Automatic Mode**: Continuously monitors and waters based on sensor readings
- **Manual Mode**: Button press triggers immediate watering regardless of moisture level
- **Temperature Alerts**: Buzzer activates when temperature exceeds 30¬∞C (every 3 seconds)

**Output Actuators:**
- **Servo Motor**: Simulates water pump, activates for 2-second watering cycles
- **LED Indicators**: Four-color visual feedback system
  - Green: Soil is wet, no watering needed
  - Yellow: Soil has medium moisture
  - Red: Soil is dry, watering active
  - Blue: Manual mode engaged
- **Piezo Buzzer**: Audio alerts for high temperature conditions

**Processing:**
- Arduino Uno microcontroller runs control algorithm
- 500ms update cycle for responsive operation
- Real-time threshold calculation based on temperature

## What Works / What Didn't

### What Works ‚úÖ

**Moisture Sensing System:**
- Soil moisture sensor provides accurate and stable analog readings
- System correctly differentiates between wet, medium, and dry soil conditions
- Threshold-based logic reliably triggers watering at appropriate times
- LED indicators clearly show current moisture status

**Temperature Monitoring:**
- TMP36 sensor accurately measures ambient temperature
- Voltage-to-Celsius conversion formula works correctly
- Adaptive threshold system successfully adjusts watering frequency during hot conditions
- Temperature alerts activate properly when threshold exceeded

**Automatic Irrigation:**
- Servo motor consistently activates for precise 2-second watering cycles
- System automatically maintains optimal soil moisture without user intervention
- Adaptive logic prevents underwatering during high temperature periods
- Quick response time (500ms update cycle) ensures timely watering

**Manual Control:**
